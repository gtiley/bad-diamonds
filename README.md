## Theory: Is a level-1 4-cycle network identifiable given the set of possible networks?
* data simulated under the multispecies coalescent with introgression (MSci) model (Flouri et al. 2020)
* networks re-estimated using the true toplogies based on unrooted quartets (Solís-Lemus and Ané 2016)
* networks re-estimated using the true topologies based on rooted triples (Yu and Nakhleh, 2015)

We are interested in the identifiability of a blob with four nodes (a diamond - Fig. 1a), and how different rootings and sampling could affect this in practice. One could consider a rooting that balances the backbone species tree (Fig. 1b), ladderizes the species tree such that the direction of gene flow is into the outgroup (Fig. 1c), or ladderizes the species tree but constrains gene flow between ingroup lineages (Fig. 1d). Taxon sampling is then investigated for each rooting by having two children per parent node, then one child for one or two parent nodes (Fig. 1e).
